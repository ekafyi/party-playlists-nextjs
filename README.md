## Usage

I made this for my own use, but feel free to fork/clone as a starter and make it your own.

Make an `.env.local` file in your project root, which will be [loaded ](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) by Next.js.

```bash
# Your Spotify developer app credentials
# See: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=

# Comma separated IDs of the playlists you want to display
PLAYLIST_IDS=

# (Optional) Use local JSON file as data source
# DEV_USE_SAMPLE_DATA=1

# These are added by Netlify in their remote env config
# URL=https://listening-party.netlify.app
# CONTEXT=production
```

I use Netlify, which automatically adds `URL` and `CONTEXT` on their remote environments. I use `process.env.URL` in some parts of the code; search and modify as needed if you use a different service.

Lastly, make sure your remote environment configuration contains the same values. Refer to these docs if you use Netlify or Vercel:
- https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/
- https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables

#### About the DEV_USE_SAMPLE_DATA config

During development, I use local JSON files as data source instead of fetching from the Spotify API, which is faster and reduces Spotify API hits. To use sample data, enable `DEV_USE_SAMPLE_DATA=1` in the environment configuration and (optionally) modify the data here https://github.com/ekafyi/party-playlists-nextjs/tree/docs/update-readme/src/sample-data.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Make sure you have obscured the playlist IDs before committing sample data from (eg.) fetch or cURL results.

Have fun and let me know what you build from this! ü§òüèΩ
